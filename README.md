The package can be installed using:

    devtools::install_github('aforren1/multimles')

You'll need to install the [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) package first, via:

    install.packages('devtools')

And dependencies (might change) include `lme4`, `TMB`, etc... which can also be installed from CRAN via `install.packages`.
